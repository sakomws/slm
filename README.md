🧭 1. Objective

Automate SOC-2 compliance evidence and secret rotation across GitHub, AWS, and internal apps, while integrating logging, validation, and deployment automation into the CI/CD pipeline.

⚙️ 2. Architecture Overview

Core Components:

SLM (Security Lifecycle Management) → tracks controls, logs, and tests.

SOC-2 Evidence Collector → aggregates logs & compliance data.

IAM Automation → rotates credentials & secrets.

App Layer → consumes rotated credentials automatically.

CI/CD Integration → pushes updated secrets, triggers deploy, logs audit trail.

🪜 3. Action Plan by Phase
Phase 1 — Foundations

Goal: Establish baseline compliance automation setup.

Tasks:

 Define SLM-to-SOC2 mapping (controls → evidence).

 Identify data sources (GitHub logs, CloudTrail, IAM, Datadog).

 Design API endpoints for SLM evidence collection.

 Store evidence in a central audit bucket or DynamoDB table.

Deliverables:

SLM–SOC2 mapping doc

Initial S3/DynamoDB schema

API prototype for evidence ingestion

Phase 2 — Secret Rotation Pipeline

Goal: Automate secret lifecycle.

Tasks:

 Integrate AWS Secrets Manager with GitHub Actions via OIDC.

 Create IAM role with least privilege for rotation tasks.

 Automate secret rotation → update Secrets Manager, push to CI/CD.

 Notify apps to redeploy with new credentials.

Deliverables:

Terraform for IAM roles and rotation Lambda

CI/CD workflow for rotation and redeploy

Audit logs captured in CloudWatch

Phase 3 — Continuous Compliance (SOC-2 Evidence)

Goal: Streamline evidence collection and validation.

Tasks:

 Implement scheduled job to collect logs (CloudTrail, GitHub Audit).

 Validate and tag logs against SOC-2 control IDs.

 Push evidence into Vanta or internal dashboard.

 Define rotation frequency policy (e.g., every 30 days).

Deliverables:

Automated evidence collector

Control validation dashboard

Rotation frequency policy doc

Phase 4 — Monitoring & Alerts

Goal: Real-time compliance visibility.

Tasks:

 Set up alerts for failed rotations or expired credentials.

 Integrate Slack notifications for SOC-2 deviations.

 Visualize metrics (rotation success rate, audit log coverage).

 Train team on interpreting compliance dashboards.

Deliverables:

CloudWatch → Slack integration

Grafana dashboard or Datadog board

SOC-2 operations playbook

🔁 5. Long-Term Steps

 Train models on historical compliance data → predictive rotation issues.

 Apply AI to auto-detect anomalies in log or control data.

 Extend to ISO 27001 or HIPAA frameworks.

🧩 Optional Integrations

GitHub Actions → SLM Collector for evidence commits.

Vanta API / Drata Sync for external compliance dashboards.

CloudTrail → S3 + Athena for queryable audit evidence.
